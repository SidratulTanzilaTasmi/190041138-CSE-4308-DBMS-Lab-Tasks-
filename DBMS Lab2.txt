CREATE TABLE grades(
Student_ID INT,
GPA FLOAT,
Semester VARCHAR2(5)

For the first table:
there are 6 attributes in the relation, among them, two attributes, ID and Mobile number are exceptional to every student. SO
these two keys are candidate key for being primary key.Among the two key, i choose ID attribute as the primary key
because each student may share the same phone number in some condition, but all the ID are unique for each and 
every student.So, for every student, this key is unique.So, ID attribute is my primary key.

TASK3:

We have taken ID as our primary key. We can prove that our key is primary through SQL. If we search for any record
with taking any value  of the ID attribute, we'll receive only one tuple. From this, it is clear that every tuple
has one unique ID, so this is our primary key.

TASK4:
IT is not possible for student_ID to be a primary key, One of the proof is if we make a query of finding the tuples with same
student_ID we will get more than one tuple. SO , this Student_ID is not unique for every rows. SO it cant be a primary key.
SELECT Student_ID FROM grades WHERE Student_ID=1;
(more than  one tuple will show up)
